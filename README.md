# Ghost-Game-2.0
 
This is currently a broken fragment of a game. It will remain as such until I can solve all the errors inside the game.


I will likely restart this project from stratch once I have a better understanding of each of the above. If not, I will have to untangle and debug it by hand, which will also take a while.


Notes for myself:

The game currently has at least somewhat functional: (meaning it works, but not as efficiently as it could)

-Player controller

-Camera controller

-Player ability to:

  -Move with WASD
  
  -Jump with space
  
  -Crouch with c
  
-Animator


The game currently has nonfunctional:

-Smooth animations

-Organized animator

-A error regarding "cleanup"

-Speed slowed upon crouch

-Roll
